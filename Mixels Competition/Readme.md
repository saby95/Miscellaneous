# Mixels Competition
I implemented all these mini-applications as a part of the 2016 competition. Open the 'ProblemStatements.pdf' file to read all the problem statements.

### Rect O'Mania
Given a binary image of non-overlapping white rectangles on a black background, count the number of rectangles in each image and print it along with the X-coordinate, Y-coordinate and angle of orientation of the longer edge from the X-axis of each rectangle.

### Pi detector
Given an image you have to estimate the number of circular-shaped objects in the image. The image will have any number of planar circular objects or projections of 3D spheres.The objects can be of any color. You can assume there will be a contrast between the color of the object and the background.

### CV scanner
You are given a raw image of a sheet of paper. You are required to give an output image which correctly segments and orients the sheet.

### Shape Detector
Given an image you have to estimate the geometric shapes and their respective numbers in the image. The image will have any number of shapes. The objects can be of any color. You can assume there will be a contrast between the color of the object and the background.
